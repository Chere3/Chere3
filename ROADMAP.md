# ROADMAP

Professional profile roadmap for the `Chere3` GitHub profile repository.

## Quick wins
- Add a portfolio maintenance protocol (monthly checks for stale links/repos).
- Standardize featured project section (problem, impact, stack, status).
- Add contribution/update process for profile refreshes.
- Add explicit contact/collaboration section.

## Medium
- Add metrics snapshots (stars, shipped releases, active PR cadence) refreshed monthly.
- Add bilingual profile mode (ES/EN switch strategy).
- Add visual portfolio cards generated from repo metadata.

## Big bets
- Auto-generate public repo digest via GitHub API + workflow.
- Add “Now / Building / Learning” sections from structured JSON data.
- Publish quarterly engineering highlights.

## Strategic rewrites
- Move from static README to template + data pipeline for maintainability.
- [x] Introduce profile quality CI checks (broken links, markdown lint, stale section markers).
