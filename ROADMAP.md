# ROADMAP

## Quick wins (1-2 weeks)
- Add profile KPIs (years experience, core domains, currently building).
- Keep featured projects section synchronized with active repositories.
- Add explicit "How I work" section (architecture, delivery cadence, quality bar).
- Add contact CTA for collaborations and technical leadership opportunities.

## Medium (2-6 weeks)
- Add GitHub Actions to validate markdown links and README style checks.
- Introduce bilingual profile blocks (EN/ES) for broader recruiter readability.
- Add pinned architecture writeups linking to high-signal repositories.

## Big bets (1-2 quarters)
- Build a public engineering portfolio site with case studies and metrics.
- Standardize maturity badges across repos (tests, coverage, docs, CI, releases).
- Publish a reusable project template for new repositories.

## Strategic rewrites (quarter+)
- Move from static profile listing to automated portfolio generation from repository metadata.
- Build a portfolio observability dashboard (repo activity, PR velocity, quality indicators).
