# Profile Maintenance Playbook

## Monthly checklist
- Re-check all links in `README.md`.
- Confirm featured projects still reflect active strategic work.
- Ensure each featured repo has:
  - Updated README
  - Setup instructions
  - ROADMAP with next milestones
  - At least one recent improvement PR

## Quarterly checklist
- Refresh achievement bullets with measurable impact.
- Revisit core stack badges to match current practice.
- Archive stale projects from the featured section.

## PR quality standard
Every profile PR should include:
1. What changed
2. Why it matters for professional positioning
3. Validation steps (links checked, sections reviewed)
