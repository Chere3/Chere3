## 👋 About
I build software that solves real operational problems.

Started by taking devices apart at 8, now working in AstraZeneca’s GITC environment through ITalent Academy (PageGroup), focused on backend systems, AI enablement, and internal automation.

I like shipping practical solutions that connect **technical quality** with **business outcomes**.

## 🏁 What I’ve achieved so far
- Delivered internal automation with Power Platform + Python (apps, flows, scripts)
- Helped reduce manual reporting workload (~30%) in support/finance workflows
- Facilitated agentic AI sessions/workshops for leadership and trainee cohorts
- Co-led technical execution in an AI startup context, contributing to $1M+ MXN in secured resources/funding

## 🚀 Projects
- **Pawsitive** — professional Discord bot platform (Seyfert + Elysia + Astro)

- **Synapse** — AI-assisted legal document analysis platform (Cerebras hackathon project)
- **Nexo** — school administration system with auth, scheduling, notifications, and cloud rollout
- **Trew** — active software project in my current workspace
- **Chaptter (Technical Co-Founder work)** — conversational AI product + cloud architecture + CI/CD
